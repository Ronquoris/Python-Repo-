Task 1:
This Python code prompts the user to enter their first and last names, stores them as strings in the variables `first` and `last`. It then prints a greeting message combining both names, welcoming the user to the program.

Task 2:
This Python code prompts the user to input two numbers (`num1` and `num2`), then performs and displays the results of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It uses formatted strings (`f"..."`) to display the results, rounding the division result to two decimal places.
